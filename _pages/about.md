## Short bio, tl;dr

You can mostly find me working on storage technologies, C++ development or performance benchmarking of applications

I like to build, test, and play with the latest technologies. These can range from C++/python libraries, developing home automation applications with Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers, test linux distros or analyzing large data sets (weather, climate, environment, finance etc.) using (not only) machine learning techniques

<span class="fa fa-tasks about-icon"></span> In the past I have worked on:
- <a href="https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_04013/epjconf_chep2021_04013.html">Investigation, benchmarking, market evalution of high-performance storage technologies </a>  (NVMe SSD, persistent memory devices, etc.)
- Research on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2438/1/012125/pdf/">Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks for particle classification</a> algorithms at CERN
- Development of <a href="https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_04014/epjconf_chep2021_04014.html">data-flow architectures for large-scale data acquisition systems (~TB/s)</a> 
- <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/papers/3276145/files/9093-proceedings_Adam_Abed_Abud.pdf/">Performance of distributed file systems</a> for large scale data-flow architectures

I'm a learning enthusiast, I am always looking for the next cool project to work on


Some more details on who I am and what I like ...
<li> I'm originally from Iraq <img src="../assets/img/iraq.png" height="20px" /> and I have lived in Italy <img src="../assets/img/italy.png" height="20px" />, Germany <img src="../assets/img/germany.png" height="20px" />, Sweden <img src="../assets/img/sweden.png" height="20px" />, France <img src="../assets/img/france.png" height="20px" /> and Switzerland <img src="../assets/img/switzerland.png" height="20px" /> </li>
<li> My interests outside of science and computers include bio-hacking, mixing cusines from different places, and reading history</li>
